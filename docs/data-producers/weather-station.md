# Weather station

A weather station located on a university campus for research purposes It consists in the following equipment.

## Barometer
This instrument measures atmospheric pressure.

## Anemometer
This device measures wind speed and direction.
The installed device  comprises a light alloy transducer containing the gonioanemo-
metric system. This system consists of a potentiometer that provides resistance proportional to the direction the wind
is blowing in.
The "O°" (North) position reference of the potentiometer is
shown by a red protrusion fitted to the body of the transducer. In the headet versions, a thermostat controls a heater
that keeps the rotor moving effectively incase of freezing. The version range includes transducers with "normalised" and
with "direct" outputs.

## Thermo-hygrometer
A thermohygrometer is a device that measures temperature and humidity. The installed device consists of two sensors, one for measuring temperature and one for measuring humidity, and a display or
output for showing the readings. The temperature sensor measures the air temperature, while the humidity sensor measures
the amount of moisture in the air, typically as a percentage of relative humidity.

## Rain gauge
The rain gauge is a tool to measure the amount and intensity of precipitation. The installed sensor
 is composed of a collection funnel for the rain that conveys the water into a double
bowl scale connected to a magnet. The magnet activates a reed relay that generates a countable impulse from an external
counter.

## Pyrheliometer
A pyrheliometer is an instrument used to measure the direct normal and horizontal solar irradiance on a surface
by tracking the sun thanks to a Sun Tracker  is installed orientated in North / South
direction. From sun rise to sun set the Sun-Tracker guarantees accurate sun tracking and pointing of the attached solar
sensors. The 2-axis tracker automatically adjusts to the sun’s position by the sun sensor closed-loop control system,
even if the tracker is not oriented or leveled properly. When the sun is absent the sun tracker will follow the solar
path by accurately calculating its position. As soon as the sun appears the radiometers will be in the proper position
to capture radiation.

## Pyranometer
The pyranometer is an instrument to measure the global sun radiation (direct and diffuse) which reaches the
terrestrial surface. With the installed instrument  it is possible (see WMO n
8 6th ed.) to measure not only the global radiation, but also the reflected sun radiation (albedometer) and the diffuse
radiation by means of the occultation band.The solarimeter measures radiation values within 300 and
3000nm, with a visibility of $2\pi$ steradians. The element used to for the measurement is a thermopile
whose external surface has been darkened with matte black paint C10 Nextel bearing a reflecting power < than 2\% (e>
0.98) in the spectral area of the sensor. Each radiometer is supplied with a
Calibration Report produced by comparison, under the sun (ISO 9847), with a radiometer calibrated at the WRC-PMOD in
Davos. An overall uncertainty value is not supplied; there are however many characteristics available according to the
classes of the WMO n8 and ISO 9060. Besides, the uncertainty of this instrument is influenced by the quick temperature
changes owing to the intervention of clouds and rain. It is not necessary to re-calibrate the instrument frequently. It
is advisable to re-calibrate the instrument every 2 to 3 years in order to keep calibration uncertainty variations in
the range of 5\%.

## Datalogger
E-Log  is a data logger for environmental applications. Due to its low consumption,
the range of signals it is able to receive, its protection against difficult environmental conditions and possible
excess voltage, it is particular suitable to carry out measures in meteorological and hydrologic applications, air
quality, internal and external environmental monitoring.
