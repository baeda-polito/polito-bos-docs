This section describes the development and deployment process of the anomaly detection application, through the Photovoltaic production estimation model, which is integrated into the EIS developed and implemented on the Politecnico di Torinoâ€™s photovoltaic plants.
After describing the available datasets, two models produced from different datasets are analysed and compared. Next, the deployment of the forecast service is described, which is necessary to enable the periodic execution of the prediction and obtain nearly real-time data.
Finally, the sections of the dashboard designed to show the results obtained and the alerting configurations created, to automate the monitoring of photovoltaic systems, are illustrated.
